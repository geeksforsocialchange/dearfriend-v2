Dear Katie G,
Thanks for believing in me, whilst I studied illustration. Your advice and influence of making masks has inspired me to carry on with my creative journey as I continue making masks.

Whilst I study an MA in Fine Art and succeed with commissions from people such as Nathaniel Mellors for his Nothing Happens Twice films commissioned as part of the KA Award.

Much love and respect,

Tribal Nick!
