Dear Amanda Palmer,

You've heard from me before, but I doubt you remember.

I wanted to tell you about the first time I heard "Sing" by the Dresden Dolls. I had never seen a woman so passionate. Before I listened to your music, I thought I needed to be quiet; I'd grown quite accustomed to being silent about a lot of things.

"Sing" perfectly encapsulated how I felt about speaking out, and gave me the courage to say "This is what I feel"; "This is what I think" and "This is what I've been through".

I'm still working on that - on being unapologetically myself. How do you do it?

I hope that I meet you again! Your work has shaped me and so many people I know.

Krystie xx
