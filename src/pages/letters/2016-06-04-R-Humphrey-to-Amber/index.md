Dear Amber,

Thank you for showing me that it's not always easier to be alone.

You inspire me with your struggle and determination to share yourself with others in a way that I didn't know how to.

I am so grateful to know someone who showed me that being out of control and falling apart isn't always the end of the world, you are so brave.

I love you

Becky xx
