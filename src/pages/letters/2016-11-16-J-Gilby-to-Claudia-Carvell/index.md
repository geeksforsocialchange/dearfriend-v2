To the woman who showed me some things are worth fighting for, and that going to political marches that are 3 people deep are still worth it, because the personal is political and that's nothing to be ashamed of.

I want to thank you for introducing me to groups of people that argued and mocked against the restraints of society. Restraints I didn't even realise existed yet. Thank you for watering my confidence and giving it enough sun light to let it grow into its own, independent body. A body that is now its very own walking, talking, political fuck you. If it weren't for the padded walls of you, I don't know if I would have made it out of the house at all on those days my head was full up with thunder storms, but I did, and you were there to cushion the blows of the stares that screamed with gendering questions, binary questions, because 'you have a pretty face but a flat chest?' type questions.

We were asked to write a letter to a woman who has influenced us, a heroine in our lives and I believe, Claudia Carvell, that you have been one of the biggest and most positive influences I have ever and will ever know. 

Thank you.
