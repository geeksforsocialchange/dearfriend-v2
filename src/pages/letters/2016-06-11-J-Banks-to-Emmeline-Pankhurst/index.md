Dear Emmeline Pankhurst

I am writing to you because you have inspired me to stand up for myself by playing football even though it's a man's sport. Even if I am only young, you have influenced on my life deeply in so many ways.

I have done an abundance of sport activities and without your help I wouldn't be who I am today. So thank you for everything.

Yours sincerely

Jessica
