To the most treasured lady in my life, my Granny Florence <3

Thank you for devoting your time, love, comfort and energy into my life and raising me with so much love and so many delicious home made pies and crumbles <3 Only God loves me more than you and the nearest to your love for me are my husband and children. You will always be a wonderful inspiration to me and to lose you to Heaven 2 days after my 19th birthday forever breaks my heart.

All my love your devoted Granddaughter Julie aged 47.
