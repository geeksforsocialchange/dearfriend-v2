To Joyce Layland
Super thank you for being so supportive to your children and for helping other parents support their queer children as well; I told my mom about you and I kind of wish she could speak to someone like you, and my dad. I've been out for three years and the first time he asked me about being gay was last week!
Also now there's this centre named after you which is really cool because I've never had access to a queer/LGBTQ-specific space because I'm from the countryside.
Thanks for being fab,
love
Emma
