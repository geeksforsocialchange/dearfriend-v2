To the woman who wrote the first book that ever made me cry,

I can't remember your name. Or what the book was called. It was written in poems and was about a girl who drew an apple every day for a month, observing it as it rotted. The apple was a metaphor for the girl's life as it fell apart around her. It was a library book; I've tried to remember your name, googling different things. I want to own a copy, to read it again and see how it makes me feel now. Reading a book that has the power to make me cry is one of my most favourite things - so I want to say thank you for introducing me to that experience. 

Thank you,

Carina x

(NB: The author's name is Sharon Creech and the book is called _Heartbeat_)
