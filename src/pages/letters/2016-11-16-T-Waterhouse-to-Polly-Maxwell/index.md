To my friend Polly,
Dear Friend, this is a letter for you. You are so wonderful, you are so forgiving. You are so patient. You are so full of love. You are so understanding and never get annoyed with me. You have given me some of the best memories, of which I am grateful; we grew from children to teenagers to adults together, and from here on we will carry on growing. At times our lives have been quite separate from each other but that never makes me sad, because I'll always find you in a cup of tea or a pint of beer or by a gas fire.

Thank you for being my  best friend.

Ting <3
