Dear Lilian Bland,

You are an amazing journalist, traveller and adventurer!

You built your own plane in Ireland in 1910 even though it didn't have a fuel tank - so you made one out of your aunt's ear trumpet and an old whiskey bottle. You then flew it (even though it was only for 30 yards - but a pretty impressive attempt nevertheless).

As well as building aeroplanes you are also a fantastic journalist, photographer and enjoyed martial arts.

At a time when women were supposed to stay at home, you smoked, wore trousers, knew how to shoot a gun and liked cars.

Your give it a go attitude is an inspiration and shows that there should be no limits to anyone.

Lucy.
