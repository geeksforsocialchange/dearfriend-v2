Dear Clara Zetkin,

Thank you for organising the first International Women's Day in 1911. Today we still celebrate this day & although there is still a lot of work to be done until we are truly equal to men, we have come a long wayfrom when you were fighting for women's rights in Bismarckian Germany. Would you believe that we are still arguing about some of the same issues now?

Your anti-war work was also incredibly inspiring and I read some of your speeches and addresses in school. 

You matter to me because you are a woman from my area who I share many values with & who stood up to be counted when it mattered. 

Thank you for all your work. 

Sylvia
