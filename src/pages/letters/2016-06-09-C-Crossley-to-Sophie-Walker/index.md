Dear Sophie Walker,

You are the face of women in politics, the face of change, the face of the future. Leading the Women's Equality Party feels like a revolutionary position (though equality should not be revolutionary of course, it should be a given). You are an inspiration and a hero.

Forever a fan,

Cat
