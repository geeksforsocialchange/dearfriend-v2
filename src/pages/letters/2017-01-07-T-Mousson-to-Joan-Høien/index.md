Dear Joan Høien,
I've only ever heard stories about you from my Mum and seen a couple of pictures she kept but I wish I could have met you in real life. You sound like a force of nature, loving food, people, life. You hated kinds and had three -- ha ha! Everyone says what a wit and sense of humour you had, and generous too, whilst being utterly strange. I miss you without knowing you. Mum keeps you alive!
Love,
Tanith
