Dear Alison Lapper,
    from the haunting painting of "A River in Winter" which I'd kept from a mouth and foot painters calendar, without knowing it was one of yours, to the sculpture of you atop the 4th plinth in Trafalgar Square, you have caught my attention.
    I so admire your determination and energy. Your honesty and truthfulness around depression /and difficulties in life. Complete respect.
    Jane x
