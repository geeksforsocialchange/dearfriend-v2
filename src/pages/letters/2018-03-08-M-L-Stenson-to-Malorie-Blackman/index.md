Dear Malorie Blackman,

I've been asked to write a letter to you. Because today is international women's day. I don't really know anything about you but what I do know is that you are a very great person and you love writing books about different races and I think that's the most greatest thing ever! You have inspired me by following your dreams, I think you're an amazing person because you inspire people to never give up. Today is my best day here because I got to know other people and you!

Thank you
Macey-Leigh Stenson
