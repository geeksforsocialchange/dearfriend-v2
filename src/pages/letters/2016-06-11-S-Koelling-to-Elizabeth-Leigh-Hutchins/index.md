Dear Elizabeth,

I wanted to write to thank you for your amazing work on the conditions of workers and working women in the early 20th century. You were a prolific researcher and as a researcher myself, I find you a role model when struggling with my motivation to keep going. So thank you, not only for the books you wrote though I'm using them for my article, but also for your strength and determination to keep going and to fight for what you believe in. You were right, we need to look at a problem holistically & to protect women workers was to protect all workers. Fighting for 'women's rights' in isolation will not achieve as much as when we stand together with others.

Thank you again for your work and your conviction.

In solidarity,

Sylvia
