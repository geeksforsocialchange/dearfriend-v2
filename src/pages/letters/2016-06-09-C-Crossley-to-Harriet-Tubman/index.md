Dear Harriet Tubman,

What a woman you are! Freeing thousands of slaves, leading a revolution, fighting against sexism and racism at a time of incredible oppression of both, despite being uneducated, and coming from a history of slavery. You are incredible and deserve recognition not only on the US dollar, but in every history book in the world.

Forever a fan,

Cat
