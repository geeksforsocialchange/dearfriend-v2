Dear Christina!
At the Dear Friend exhibition and was asked to write a letter to a woman who I care about. Wanted to write a letter to you as you're my best friend, I like your ginger hair, your dry humour and your awkward body. What more could I want in a gal? Sorry I'm an argumentative bean, I hope you love me regardless. Let's go on more adventures!
Space Odyssey!
Love Katie
