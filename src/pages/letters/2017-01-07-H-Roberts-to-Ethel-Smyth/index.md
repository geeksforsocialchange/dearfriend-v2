For Ethel Smyth,
Your activism was as a suffragette which was a brilliant cause, obviously. I know you from your musical works and even in that arena you were groundbreaking and rebellious -- becoming a composer despite your father's hearty disapproval but went on regardless. Regardless is a good word for you, I think. You became a composer regardless of familial disappointment. You became a suffragette despite threats and violence. You lived openly as a bisexual regardless of social norms and stigma. That's what I admire -- your living your life <u>regardless</> of what people think. A rebel from the start. So thanks for that.
Heather
