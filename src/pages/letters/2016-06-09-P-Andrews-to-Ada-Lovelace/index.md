Dear Ada Lovelace,

You taught me that women could be involved in technology and do inventive things and that being creative wasn't incompatible with understanding how things work - even if the men usually get the credit.

I went to uni at 28 and got an IT degree, then a Masters and now I'm doing a PhD.

Trying to get stuff done before the evil robots / evil algorithms take over the world.

Cheers!

Penny
