Dear Ellen Johnson Sirleaf,
A nation will forever be in your gratitude for your sacrifices and bravery. When the odds were stacked against you, you continued to fight for freedom and fairness. I hope that Liberia will continue to grow and thrive through the rest of your presidency and that you have lead the way for future leaders of Africa and that young African women will now believe they can be those leaders too.
Thank you,
Rob
