Dear Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,

You are an awesome writer - you've written three novels by the age of 37 which is fairly epic. Your novels are fantastic - they open up the world as well as people's hearts and minds. I've just finished re-reading Americana and it is awesome! You write of places I don't know (Nigeria, the US) and places I do know (London) with such warmth and detail and openness.
You've also done some brilliant TED talks - "We Should All Be Feminists" was so good even Beyonc√© loved it and included excerpts in her song "Flawless". I also love your "Dangers of a Single Story" talk - everyone should watch it! You've inspired me to think differently about the world, and, for that I say: thanks!

Katie
