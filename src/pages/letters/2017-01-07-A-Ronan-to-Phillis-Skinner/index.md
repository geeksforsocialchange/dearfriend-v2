Dear Phillis Skinner,
You have been an inspiration to me since I read your cry for us "<u>to clamorously and unceasingly agitate</u>" for peace, for women's rights, for love.
You were so hard to find -- you ran away from London in 1912 to live with the young socialist Allen Skinner in Manchester. You left London, you got divorced, you had a child with Allen - little Jack - you went to prison for handing out anti-war leaflets in 1917. You never stopped campaigning for peace + believing there could be a better world! Thank you. As your friend Hope said: " You (were) an AMAZING woman."
