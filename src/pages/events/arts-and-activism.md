Dear Friend is a letter writing project that explores the roles women played in all struggles of liberation. As part of Dear Friend's first exhibition, there is another chance to take part in the project and write a letter to an amazing woman. This time we are celebrating all kinds of women involved in both DIY art and activism, from Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Riviera to Nina Power and our very own Amelia Lee. Come by the stall and write a letter to your heronine to help correct the balance of history.

This event is free. Please book [here on Eventbrite](http://dear-friend-art-and-activism.eventbrite.co.uk)
