Women writers have existed since antiquity, many creating works under their own names, such as Gormflaith ingen Flann Sinna, Juliana Berners, or Julian of Norwich. Granted, later on, many had to hide the fact that they were women in order to be published, something still prevalent today. So let’s celebrate all literary women, from Gwerful Mechain, a 15th century Welsh poet, to Mary Wollstonecraft-Shelley, a 19th century novelist, to JK Rowling, a 21st century writer. Let’s write letters to the women who would not be silenced, who told stories, poems, and histories and who may not be remembered the way they deserve. Come to the workshop, learn more about literary women, and write a letter that helps correct the balance of history.

The workshop will be preceded by an informal tour of the House, exploring the time in which Elizabeth Gaskell lived, and how she and her contemporaries matched gender expectations.

Free workshop - usual House admission charges apply. £4.95 adult, £3.95 concessions. Tickets last for a year so you can keep visiting!

This event is part of Wonder Women, Manchester’s annual feminist festival. From 2-12 March 2017, we celebrate the women’s movement born in our city through a radical programme of cultural events, asking how far we’ve come in 100 years – and how far we have yet to go.
