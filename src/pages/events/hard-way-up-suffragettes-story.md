Hannah Mitchell was a local councillor in Manchester in the early 20th century and fought for peace and women’s suffrage when the country was at war and women did not have the vote. There were many women like Hannah over time and there are quite a few still with us today. Fancy learning more about Hannah and women like her? Come to the fascinating living history performance at PHM and learn more about Hannah’s life and then join us in a letter writing workshop after the performance. The workshop will be run by Julia Nelson and you will have ample opportunity to learn more about different women in the past and the present if you don’t already know who to write to. The letters will be added to the digital collection at dearfriend.org.uk and some will be displayed during March in the main galleries at PHM. Come and celebrate women in public life with us!
