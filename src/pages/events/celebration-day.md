Dear Friend is a letter writing project celebrating women in public life and in struggles for liberation. Come to this workshop to learn more about the role that women played in Manchester life, both in the past and in the present. Manchester has seen women involved in all walks of life: from Mary Fiedes and the fight for universal suffrage, to Margaret Ashton, the first local councillor, to Mary Greg, famously collecting artefacts from a dying time, to Catherine Chisholm founding Britainâ€™s first Baby Hospital. 

This event is free. Please book [here on Eventbrite](http://dear-friend-celebration-day.eventbrite.co.uk/?s=65519162)
