At a time of Section 28, the AIDS crisis, and police raids on gay bars, Friends and Families of Lesbians and Gays (FFLAG) supported young and older lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans* (lgbt) people all over the country with letters and information about being l, g, b, or t. A lot of this work was carried out by mothers and sisters of lgbt people who had seen first-hand the damage misinformation, prejudice and unhappiness can cause.

Come and learn more about these amazing women who spoke to gay teens in the middle of the night on the phone, sent letters far and wide, and spread a message of love and acceptance at a time of dire need. Explore the archives of FFLAG and other groups from the early 1990s onwards and write a letter to one of the women involved or another inspiring woman in public life.
