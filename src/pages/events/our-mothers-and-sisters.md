Women from the North West have involved themselves in political struggles for a long time, be that the struggle for suffrage, equal wages, or access to birth control. This workshop explores the roles that local women played in the *Women’s Liberation Movement* (1960s-1980s), the causes that mobilised women across the decades, and the achievements of women such as Lizzie Gent, SuAndi, and Marie Brookfield. Come to the workshop to discover the newly acquisitioned **Feminist Webs Archive** and write a letter to an inspirational woman.

This event is part of Wonder Women, Manchester’s annual feminist festival. From 2-12 March 2017, we celebrate the women’s movement born in our city through a radical programme of cultural events, asking how far we’ve come in 100 years – and how far we have yet to go.
