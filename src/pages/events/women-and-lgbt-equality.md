As part of Dear Friend's exhibition, we are celebrating those women who fought for sexual and gender equality, be that in the eyes of the law or the eyes of society. You are invited to write a letter to Marsha P. Johnson, Amelia Lee, Jan Bridget, and others without whom we would not enjoy the freedom we do today. Come by the stall and write a letter to your heroine to help correct the balance of history.

This event is free. Please book [here on Eventbrite](https://dear-friend-women-and-lgbt-equality.eventbrite.co.uk)
