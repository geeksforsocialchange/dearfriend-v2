We are thrilled to announce Dear Friend's exhibition of letters to amazing women in Nexus Art Cafe which will run until 15th January 2017. Come by the Cafe and read letters to Ellen Wilkinson, Barbara Castle, Phyllis Monk, Clara Zetkin and many more. Let's celebrate all kinds of women, from politicians and artists, to scientist, friends, mothers, grandmothers, and activists.

There is a chance to write your own letter and post it in the post box provided.

The exhibition is free and in the Nook area of Nexus Art Cafe.
