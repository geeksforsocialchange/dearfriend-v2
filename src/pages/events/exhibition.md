Dear Friend is a letter writing project that explores the roles women played in all struggles of liberation. We are thrilled to announce Dear Friend's first exhibition of letters to amazing women. Come by the gallery and read letters to Ellen Wilkinson, Barbara Castle, Phyllis Monk, Clara Zetkin and many more. Let's celebrate all kinds of women, from politicians and artists, to scientist, friends, mothers, grandmothers, and activists.

This event is free.
