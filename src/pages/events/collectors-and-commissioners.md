Women in the arts are commonly portrayed as simply being muses or models: but of course the history of art is saturated with women artists, collectors, commissioners and patrons. Involvement of women in the arts has been multi-faceted not only in recent times. Come to the workshop, learn more about women in the arts, and write a letter to a woman who did amazing things, be that collector and connoisseur Mary Greg, artist Sonia Boyce, or gallery owner and Society of Women Artist president Barbara Tate. Take part in Dear Friend and help correct the balance of history.
