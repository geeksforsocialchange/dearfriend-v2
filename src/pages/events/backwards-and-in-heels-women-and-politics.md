Politics has generally been a male domain, but women have been involved in the political process for a long time. Some were Queen Regnant, such as Elizabeth I, some campaigned for universal suffrage alongside men, such as Mary Fiedes, and some even ran for office, such as Constance Markievicz, Nancy Astor, or Margaret Ashton. Many women have also been involved in the ongoing struggle for labour rights, equal pay, equal representation, and equal opportunities for all. Come by the stall, take part in Dear Friend and write a letter to a woman who involved in politics and correct the balance of history.
