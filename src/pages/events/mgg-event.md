For this workshop, we are teaming up with [Manchester Geek Girls](https://manchestergirlgeeks.com/) who have invited us to one of their amazing Tea Parties.

Come by, drink tea, eat cake, write letters to amazing women in STEM and Medicine and help raise the profile of forgotten women in this field.

We will also have staff and students from the [Centre for the History of Science, Technology and Medicine](http://www.chstm.manchester.ac.uk/) (part of the University of Manchester), who will be helping us find resources for women who may have been overlooked by history.
