Dear Friend is a letter-writing project celebrating women who stood up for others, past and present. Officially launching 8th March for International Women's Day 2016.

## Write a letter

We're now welcoming submissions! Write a letter to support a woman who inspired you or who made a difference in an area of equality: such as the fight against slavery; racial discrimination; or the ongoing fight for peace. We'll digitise and transcribe it, put it on the website, and help raise the profile of whoever you think we need to celebrate. You can write anything from a postcard to a full letter, and hand-write it or type it.

[Check out our full submission guidelines for how to contribute.](/guidelines.html)

### Living History: The Hard Way up – A Suffragette's Story

#### Tue 8th March 1:15 - 2:00pm, [People's History Museum](http://www.phm.org.uk/).

*From 2:15 - 4:15pm, there will be a Dear Friend letter writing workshop as a response to the performance.*

Hannah Mitchell was a local councillor in Manchester in the early 20th century and fought for peace and women’s suffrage when the country was at war and women did not have the vote. There were many women like Hannah over time and there are quite a few still with us today. Fancy learning more about Hannah and women like her? Come to the fascinating living history performance at PHM and learn more about Hannah’s life and then join us in a letter writing workshop after the performance. The workshop will be run by Julia Nelson and you will have ample opportunity to learn more about different women in the past and the present if you don’t already know who to write to. The letters will be added to the digital collection at dearfriend.org.uk and some will be displayed during March in the main galleries at PHM. Come and celebrate women in public life with us!

### “I Think I'm Gay, Can You Help Me?” Exploring the archives of Friends and Families of Lesbians and Gays.

#### 12th March 2:00-4:00pm, [Manchester Central Library Archives+](http://www.archivesplus.org/about-archives/).

At a time of Section 28, the AIDS crisis, and police raids on gay bars, Friends and Families of Lesbians and Gays (FFLAG) supported young and older lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans* (lgbt) people all over the country with letters and information about being l, g, b, or t. A lot of this work was carried out by mothers and sisters of lgbt people who had seen first-hand the damage misinformation, prejudice and unhappiness can cause.

Come and learn more about these amazing women who spoke to gay teens in the middle of the night on the phone, sent letters far and wide, and spread a message of love and acceptance at a time of dire need. Explore the archives of FFLAG and other groups from the early 1990s onwards and write a letter to one of the women involved or another inspiring woman in public life.

*In Performance Space 1, on the ground floor in Archives+. [Eventbrite booking link](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/dear-friend-i-think-im-gay-can-you-help-me-tickets-20986204302).*

*This workshop is for over 14s only.*
